# Machine-Learning-Marathon

This repository contains my coursework and practice materials from the Machine Learning Marathon offered by Cupoy (https://www.cupoy.com/).

It covers a wide range of machine learning fundamentals and practical implementation exercises, including:
- Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Regression Models (Linear, Ridge, Lasso, Polynomial)
- Classification Models (Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost, SVM)
- Unsupervised Learning (K-Means, PCA)
- Model Evaluation & Cross-Validation
- Neural Network Basics and Gradient Descent implementation from scratch
